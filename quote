Single Quote VS Double Quote

Example1：

>>> "Hello,world!"
'Hello,world'

Seems not too much difference there. But there is.

Example2：

>>>" Let's go!"
"Let's go!"
>>>' "Hello, world!" She said'
' "Hello, world!" She said'

The examples above have used both single quote and double quote. If only used one of them, say, single quote only.
It will show up syntax errors. That's why we need to add escape, \' \"

>>> ' Let\'s go!'
"Let's go!"
>>>"\"Hello, world!\" She said "
'"Hello,world" She said'

>>> '''"No, thanks, Mom," I said, "I don't know how long it will take."'''
'"No, thanks, Mom," I said, "I don\'t know how long it will take."'
